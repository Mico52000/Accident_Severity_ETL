    "- Load dataset\n",
    "- Explore the dataset and ask atleast 5 questions to give you a better understanding of the data provided to you. \n",

    "- Cleaing the data\n",
    "- Observe missing data and comment on why you believe it is missing(MCAR,MAR or MNAR) \n",
    "- Observe duplicate data\n",
    "- Observe outliers\n",
    "- After observing outliers,missing data and duplicates, handle any unclean data.\n",
    "- With every change you are making to the data you need to comment on why you used this technique and how has it affected the data(by both showing the change in the data i.e change in number of rows/columns,change in distrubution, etc and commenting on it).\n",
    "- Data transformation and feature engineering\n",
    "- Add a new column named 'Week number' and discretisize the data into weeks according to the dates.Tip: Change the datatype of the date feature to datetime type instead of object.\n",
    "- Encode any categorical feature(s) and comment on why you used this technique and how the data has changed.\n",
    "- Identify feature(s) which need normalisation and show your reasoning.Then choose a technique to normalise the feature(s) and comment on why you chose this technique.\n",
    "- Add atleast two more columns which adds more info to the dataset by evaluating specific feature(s). I.E( Column indicating whether the accident was on a weekend or not). \n",
    "- For any imputation with arbitrary values or encoding done, you have to store what the value imputed or encoded represents in a new csv file. I.e if you impute a missing value with -1 or 100 you must have a csv file illustrating what -1 and 100 means. Or for instance, if you encode cities with 1,2,3,4,etc what each number represents must be shown in the new csv file.\n",
    "- Load the new dataset into a csv file.\n",
    "- **Extremely Important note** - Your code should be as generic as possible and not hard-coded and be able to work with various datasets. Any hard-coded solutions will be severely penalised.\n",
    "- Bonus: Load the dataset as a parquet file instead of a csv file(Parquet file is a compressed file format)."

The initial hypothesis was that conducting the test would point out the specific variables on which road_type is dependant and would thus highlight if the variable is MAR. To conduct the test, a new boolean column was created to indicate whether road_type is missing for this datapoint, and then the independence of that boolean attribute was tested against all other attributes. After conducting the test, it was discovered that the attribute road_type depends on multiple columns, with various degrees of dependence."

Furthermore, it can be seen that the road_surface_conditions is more likely to be missing when a police officer does not attend the scene of the accident.  This logically makes sense as there is no police officer to record the weather condition of the scene and hence the data might go missing during reporting later on."

Hence, to maintain the statistical profile of this column's distribution, we decided to impute with values sampled form same column with certain conditions (to keep the semantics of the dataset intact). Namely, we first removed the data points containing with the value daylight, since they semantically have nothing to do with the light condition in darkness. Then from the remaining darkness values, we randomly sampled a value (between lights lit, lights unlit, and no lighting) and imputed the Darkness - lighting unknown values with it.

    "### According to the ISO standard when it comes to dates, specifically the ISO 8601, if the 1st day of the year is on a Friday, Saturday, or Sunday, it is assigned week 52 or week 53 of the previous year. The ISO week numbering starts with 1 at the first Monday of the year. Since our dataset is only concerned with a specific year, it was decided to assign those dates 0 rather than 52 or 53. This will allow us to abide as much as possible by the ISO standard without introducing the confusion of having another year in a dataset with only one year."

    "## ``Encoding Day of the week``\n",
    "### If we use Label encoding here, each day of the week would be assigned a numeric label from 1-7, and because of this, any model will consequently identify relationships such as Sunday(6) > Saturday(5). Some models, for example, a linear regressor, will assume that Sunday (6) is bigger (or carries more weight) than all other days in the week. This is misleading. For now, this assumption does not make much sense and the sense of the ordinality can be ignored since we have more meaningful relationships between their values that can be inferred without label encoding. since the cardinality of the road class column is quite low, we can safely use one hot encoding. We can also drop the last column to decrease the dimensionality of the output dataset since the last column can be easily inferred from the rest. Here, it is the case that no column can be favored for dropping as they all give the same semantic meaning.\n"

    "### We will encode road_surface_conditions using one-hot encoding. It was decided to use this method since the values of the road_surface_conditions have no inherent order to them. Thus, using label encoding would be misleading since it will introduce order. Furthermore, the caridnality of the attribute is relatively low, so using one-hot encoding will not excessively increase dimensionality. Finally, we dropped one of the columns to decrease the dimensionality of the output dataset since the last column can be easily inferred from the rest. In this case, we will favor dropping the column that represents a dry road surface as it is considered as the base case (no rain or snow or floods). Hence, it can be easily inferred from the absence of the aformentioned weather phenomenon.\n"

Thus, using label encoding would be misleading since it will introduce order. Furthermore, the caridnality of the attribute is relatively low, so using one-hot encoding will not excessively increase dimensionality. Finally, we dropped one of the columns to decrease the dimensionality of the output dataset since the last column can be easily inferred from the rest. There is no column here that could be favored to drop so we will intuitively dropped the first column.\n"

    "### We will encode light_conditions using one-hot encoding. It was decided to use this method since the values of the light_conditions have no inherent order to them. Thus, using label encoding would be misleading since it will introduce order. Furthermore, the caridnality of the attribute is relatively low, so using one-hot encoding will not excessively increase dimensionality. Finally, we dropped one of the columns to decrease the dimensionality of the output dataset since the last column can be easily inferred from the rest. Here, it is another case of dropping the column that represents a base case value. Daylight here can be easily inferred from the lack or absence of the several darkness columns.\n"

    "## ``Encoding weather_conditions``\n",
    "### We will encode weather_conditions using one-hot encoding. It was decided to use this method since the values of the weather_conditions have no inherent order to them. Thus, using label encoding would be misleading since it will introduce order. Furthermore, the caridnality of the attribute is relatively low, so using one-hot encoding will not excessively increase dimensionality. Finally, we dropped one of the columns to decrease the dimensionality of the output dataset since the last column can be easily inferred from the rest. A decision here was made to drop the other column as it is very easy to interpret the other category from the absence of the rest of the categories.\n"

Thus, using label encoding would be misleading since it will introduce order. Furthermore, the caridnality of the attribute is relatively low, so using one-hot encoding will not excessively increase dimensionality. Finally, we dropped one of the columns to decrease the dimensionality of the output dataset since the last column can be easily inferred from the rest. A decision here was made to drop the other column as it is very easy to interpret the other category from the absence of the rest of the categories.\n"

    "### We will encode junction_control using one-hot encoding. It was decided to use this method since the values of the junction_control have no inherent order to them. Thus, using label encoding would be misleading since it will introduce order. Furthermore, the caridnality of the attribute is relatively low, so using one-hot encoding will not excessively increase dimensionality. Finally, we dropped one of the columns to decrease the dimensionality of the output dataset since the last column can be easily inferred from the rest. A decision here was made to drop the 'Data missing or out of range' column as it is very easy to interpret the other category from the absence of the rest of the categories. \n"

    "### We will encode pedestrian_crossing_human_control using one-hot encoding. It was decided to use this method since the values of the pedestrian_crossing_human_control have no inherent order to them. Thus, using label encoding would be misleading since it will introduce order. Furthermore, the caridnality of the attribute is relatively low, so using one-hot encoding will not excessively increase dimensionality. Finally, we dropped one of the columns to decrease the dimensionality of the output dataset since the last column can be easily inferred from the rest. A decision here was made to drop the 'None within 50 metres' column as it is very easy to interpret the other category from the absence of the rest of the categories. \n"

    "### We will encode pedestrian_crossing_physical_facilities using one-hot encoding. It was decided to use this method since the values of the pedestrian_crossing_physical_facilities have no inherent order to them. Thus, using label encoding would be misleading since it will introduce order. Furthermore, the caridnality of the attribute is relatively low, so using one-hot encoding will not excessively increase dimensionality. Finally, we dropped one of the columns to decrease the dimensionality of the output dataset since the last column can be easily inferred from the rest. A decision here was made to drop the 'No physical crossing facilities within 50 metres' column as it is very easy to interpret the other category from the absence of the rest of the categories. \n"

    "### We will encode special_conditions_at_site using one-hot encoding. It was decided to use this method since the values of the special_conditions_at_site have no inherent order to them. Thus, using label encoding would be misleading since it will introduce order. Furthermore, the caridnality of the attribute is relatively low, so using one-hot encoding will not excessively increase dimensionality. Finally, we dropped one of the columns to decrease the dimensionality of the output dataset since the last column can be easily inferred from the rest. A decision here was made to drop the 'None' column as it is very easy to interpret the other category from the absence of the rest of the categories. \n"

    "### We will encode carriageway_hazards using one-hot encoding. It was decided to use this method since the values of the carriageway_hazards have no inherent order to them. Thus, using label encoding would be misleading since it will introduce order. Furthermore, the caridnality of the attribute is relatively low, so using one-hot encoding will not excessively increase dimensionality. Finally, we dropped one of the columns to decrease the dimensionality of the output dataset since the last column can be easily inferred from the rest. A decision here was made to drop the 'None' column as it is very easy to interpret the other category from the absence of the rest of the categories. \n",

    "## ``Encoding police_force``\n",
    "### Since there is no inherent order to the police force column, one-hot encoding would generally be preferred. However, given the massive cardinality of this column and the fact that that all the values appear with significant frequencies in the dataset, we cannot reccommend the use of one-hot encoding or one-hot encoding of frequent categories. Thus, although it is not  completely optimal, we will opt to label encode this column."

However, given the massive cardinality of this column and the fact that that all the values appear with significant frequencies in the dataset, we cannot reccommend the use of one-hot encoding or one-hot encoding of frequent categories. Thus, although it is not  completely optimal, we will opt to label encode this column."

To add on, if the actual LSOA region of the accident is needed, the provided CSV look up can always be used.\n"
